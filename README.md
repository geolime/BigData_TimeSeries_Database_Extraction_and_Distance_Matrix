# BigData_TimeSeries_Database_Extraction_and_Distance_Matrix
An R programming script designed to extract data from a 25+ million record database of Swedish residents who lived in Sweden over a 27 year time series from 1990 to 2017. The extraction and analysis of which was for residents who lived in Malmö and were employed in and outside of Malmö and residents who lived elsewhere in Sweden and where employed in Malmö.

The databases had varying levels of data standard changes within the time series thus multiple extraction loops needed to be created for handling the variations.
These time periods were:

**1990-1997**

**1998-2003**

**2004**

**2005-2014**

**2015-2017**

Includes creating a distance matrix for the 7 closest stations within the municipality of Malmö.
